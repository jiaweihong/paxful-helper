# Paxful Helper 

## What is Paxful Helper?

Paxful Helper is a Google chrome extension that scrapes and calculates relevant metrics from other Paxful user/vendor's profile page, after which it injects the data directly onto the HTML of the page. The aim of the extension was to allow potential buyers / sellers to more easily verify if a vendor was trustworthy or not.

The highlighted sections are the additional content that will be generated to the page when you download the extension.
